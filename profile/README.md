## Guiding Priniciples

This project has a few important principles which guide development:

* Community: If a newbie has a bad time, it’s a bug.
* Engineering: Make it work, make it right, then make it fast – in that order.
* Capabilities: If it doesn’t do a thing today, we can make it do it tomorrow.

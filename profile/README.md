## Hello World 👋

Welcome to the Bluebird project which wants to create and maintain the best monitoring system for people working who need to deal with complex IT network infrastructure under the open source license AGLPLv3.

This organization is the place for organizing work and discussions, the source code repositories, website, and documentation.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

## Guiding Priniciples

This project has a few important principles which guide development:

* Community: If a newbie has a bad time, it’s a bug.
